- Identify **peak demand hours and days**
- Understand **trip distance and duration patterns**
- Analyze **revenue and fare behavior**
- Perform **data-driven insight generation**

---

## 📦 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains structured Uber ride-level data including:

- Trip ID  
- Pickup Date & Time  
- Pickup Location  
- Trip Distance  
- Trip Duration  
- Fare Amount  
- Payment Details  

The dataset reflects **real-world ride-hailing data**, suitable for analytical and business use cases.
